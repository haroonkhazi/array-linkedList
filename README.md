# array-linkedList
To run the the demo file, in the terminal run:

java Project1/demo.java “prefix”

“prefix” is a string containing the prefix you want to check, e.g. 248

The values inserted into both arraylist and linkedlist are below

"haroon", 2484102642L

"dev", 216999312L

"red", 2481039210L

"setsun", 2163922003L

"seth", 2169219031L

"himari", 5489939999L

 "dave", 2483922333L

The demo file will output what type of list it is summing and then it will output the number of people with the prefix that you have input. 

An example: 

$  java Project1/demo "248"

	arraylist
	
	3 people with 248 prefix
	
	linkedlist
	
	3 people with 248 prefix
